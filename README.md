# Statistics and Analytics for the Social and Computing Sciences

This is a working collection of statistics notes that I am compiling.

Topics that I would like to eventually cover with this set of notes include:

- Data Wrangling / Data Munging (Data structures and type; How to shape data)
- Descriptive Statistics (Means, Standard Deviations, etc...)
- Data Visualization
- Regression Analysis / Linear modelling, including generalized linear models, multiple regression, and interactions
- Linear mixed-effects modelling
- Probability
- Monte Carlo Simulations (including using simulations to do non-parametric statistics like the bootstrap)
- Power analyses
- Introduction to Data Mining techniques
- Good (R & R Markdown; analysis) Practices
