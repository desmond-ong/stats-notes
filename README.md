# Statistics and Analytics for the Social and Computing Sciences

This is a working collection of statistics notes that I am compiling, in particular to supplement my course *BT1101: Introduction to Business Analytics*, at the National University of Singapore. Note, I don't teach the course every semester, and the syllabus is always evolving, so current students of this course should use this only as a reference. (Unless you are taking my course, then you can ask me directly).

Topics that I would like to eventually cover with this set of notes include:

- Data Munging
- Descriptive Statistics
- Data Visualization
- Regression Analysis (including multiple regression and interactions; mixed-effects modelling)
- Time Series Analysis
- Introduction to Data Mining techniques
- Simple linear optimization / with integer constraints.
- Monte carlo simulations (including using simulations to do non-parametric statistics like the bootstrap)
- Good (R & R Markdown; analysis) Practices
